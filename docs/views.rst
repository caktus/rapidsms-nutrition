The rapidsms-nutrition app defines a single view through which web users may
see nutrition reports.

**Ordering.** Reports are listed according to the date at which they were
created, with the most recent reports first. By clicking on a column header,
you can reorder the data by that column. By clicking a column a second time,
the data will be ordered by that column in reverse.

**Filtering.** Reports may be filtered by reporter, patient, or status. To
apply filtering, click on the value that you wish to filter by.
