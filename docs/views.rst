The rapidsms-nutrition app defines a single view through which web users may
see nutrition reports.

**Ordering.** Reports are listed according to the date at which they were
created, with the most recent reports first. By clicking on a column header,
you can reorder the data by that column. By clicking a column a second time,
the data will be ordered by that column in reverse.

**Filtering.** Reports can be filtered by patient, reporter, and status using
the filters form on the left of the page. The view will only show reports
which match all filters.

**Export.** You can use the "Export results as CSV" link on the page to export
tabular data for all results matching the current filters.
