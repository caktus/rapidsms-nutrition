Release: v\ |release|.

rapidsms-nutrition is an app which monitors child growth using `RapidSMS
<http://rapidsms.readthedocs.org>`_.

It allows you to create instant statistical assessments based on WHO Child
Growth Standards, using the `pygrowup <https://github.com/ewheeler/pygrowup>`_
library.

This app is based on the work in the `nutrition app
<https://github.com/mwana/mwana/tree/develop/mwana/apps/nutrition>`_ in Project
Mwana, which is in turn based on the work in `rapidsms-growth-monitoring
<https://github.com/ewheeler/rapidsms-growthmonitoring-app>`_ app.
